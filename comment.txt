For whatever reason, the pull request is missing from your repository. This is a problem because that means that I can't give feedback where I normally do.

There is one problem in your code in part 5: the condition in the 2nd elif statement should include "and" only, not "or". Your code fails in the case where the input is a valid month with 30 days (e.g. "april").
Other than that, nice job.
